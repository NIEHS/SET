## The Spatiotemporal Exposures and Toxicology group, i.e. {SET} group, has a broad interest in geospatial [exposomics](https://factor.niehs.nih.gov/2022/9/feature/2-feature-exposomics-research) and risk mapping. Key areas of research include:

#### ***Geospatial Exposure:*** Spatiotemporal exposure mapping of environmental and climate variables (e.g. chemical mixtures, social, behaviorial, environmental, and climate factors)

#### ***GeoTox:*** Otherwise known as **source-to-outcome** modeling, GeoTox is the integration of geospatial exposures, toxicokinetic modeling, and non-animal toxicological data such as high-through *in vitro* screen assays to develop mechanistically-informed risk maps

#### ***Software:*** Developing and promoting software and computational best-practices such as test-driven-development ([TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)) and open-source code for the environmental health sciences
