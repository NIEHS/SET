# Overview

## About Us

**Spatiotemporal Exposures and Toxicology {SET} group**

-   Geospatial Exposure Mapping: Spatiotemporal exposure mapping of environmental and climate variables (e.g. chemical mixtures, social, behaviorial, environmental, and climate factors)
-   GeoTox: Otherwise known as **source to outcome continuum** modeling, GeoTox is the integration of geospatial exposures, toxicokinetic modeling, and non-animal toxicological data such as high-through *in vitro* screen assays to develop mechanistically-informed risk maps of chemical mixtures
-   Software Development: Developing and promoting software and computational best-practices such as test driven development (TDD) and open-source code for the environmental health sciences

## About Us

![](../20240222_UNC_ESE_Guest_Lecture/SETgroup-Oct2023.jpg)

## CHORDS Project

-   I am a co-lead on the CHORDS project with Aubrey Miller, Charles Schmitt, and Trisha Castranio.
-   David Reif, Alison Motsigner-Reif, David Fargo, among many others involved a regular contributors
-   The project represents a major NIEHS initiative for climate change and health research that I am involved in. It has come with additional monies for postdocs and data analysts in my group
-   It also comes with significant time commitments and responsibilities
-   A lot of the CHORDS work/deliverables are folded into my group's work and manuscripts

## Group Management

-   In late 2023/ early 2024, with help from the new CHORDS funding, my group was poised to expand from 2 postdocs to 5 postdocs and a data analyst.
-   I took 30 hours of project management courses to prepare
-   I adopted software best practices as both a technique to help manage the group and to improve the quality of our software products, as well as increase software as a product of our research group
-   Software best practices will help ensure that I have knowledge retention, reproducibility, and extensibility built into the core of my group
    -   You'll see why this is important in the next few slides

## Software and Computational Best Practices

-   Test Driven Development
-   Continuous Integration
-   Build Checks
-   Style/Linting
-   Workflows/Pipelines

# Group Personnel Updates

## Daniel Zilber

-   Postdoc with me \~2.5 years
-   1 first/last author publication (Zilber and Messier, 2024)
-   1 first/second author publication (me 2nd, Matt Wheeler last) in major revisions
-   1 last/second (me last, Daniel 2nd) in press
-   Daniel is now a staff scientist with Shanshan Zhao as of July 7, 2024 (BCBB)
-   Overall, Daniel has been an excellent postdoc and demonstrated how providing flexibility and intellectual freedom can lead to high-impact research

## Ranadeep Daw

-   Postdoc with me 1 year
-   0 publications or products. 1 manuscript in progress, but not holding my breath for seeing it completed
-   Overall, disappointing, not meeting expectations, and negative attitude
-   Complained about data set being too large for the proposed methodology, then complained about it being too small
-   Nonetheless, a positive outcome as he accepted a position as a tenure-track assistant professor in Statistics at the University of West Florida

## Insang Song

-   Postdoc with me 1 year and as a contractor for 4 months before that
-   1st author publication in NIEHS internal review (`chopin` software manuscript).
-   1st author publication (`beethoven` group project) in preparation.
-   2nd author on `PrestoGP` manuscript in preparation
-   **Recent Big News** He has been offered and accepted a tenure-track assistant professor position at Seoul National University (Top Public University in Korea- Top 30-50 Worldwide). It is a great opportunity for him for a highly competitive position. A bit bittersweet for me because he has been an amazing postdoc and extremely productive.
    -   Start date is surprisingly soon, Sept 1 2024.

## Eva Marques

-   Postdoc with me 1 year
-   Excellent group member and attitude
-   Project on high-resolution heat exposure mapping is going well
    -   2 first author publications in progress. 1 first author publication in 2025 is realistic.

## Mariana Alifa Kassien

-   Postdoc with me 1 year
-   Excellent group member and positive attiude
-   Project goal is to develop a geospatial of 100+ VOCs in air.
    -   The methodology has changed from a physics-informed neural network to something more tractable that builds upon our previous spatial models and pipeline developments.
    -   Additionally, we hope to integrate this into the **GeoTox** framework towards a geospatial mixtures risk assessment.
-   Spends 10-20% of her time working with the CHORDS knowledge dissemination team and has some interest science communication and outreach.
-   Was on maternity leave from Mar - May 2024.

## Mitchell Manware

-   With me 1 year as a fully-remote data analyst supported by the CHORDS project.
-   Has been a great team member contributing to `amadeus` and `beethoven` software as well as leading the first-author for the `amadeus` manuscript (currently under internal NIEHS review).
-   He is interested in doing a PhD with the goal of learning and developing ML/AI models for environmental exposure and risk assessment, but has a likely geographical constraint of New England. Will discuss the possibility of supporting a PhD at UNC ESE.

## Postbac Outcomes

-   **Taylor Potter**, BS, IRTA Postbac 2020-2022, now in MD program at Meherry Medical College

-   **Melissa Lowe**, BS, MS, IRTA Postbac 2020-2022, 1st author publication, Biostatistician at Duke Cancer Center, Recently resigned to purse a JD and focus on environmental justice, I wrote her a recomomendation letter for law school.

## Postdoc Outcomes

-   **Dr. Kristin Eccles** - Research Scientist, Computational Toxicology Research group, Exposure and Biomonitoring Division, Health Canada

-   **Dr. Ranadeep Daw** - Tenure Track Assistant Professor, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of West Florida

-   **Dr. Daniel Zilber** - Staff Scientist, BCBB, NIEHS

-   **Dr. Insang Song** - Tenure Track Assistant Professor, Seoul National University

## Summer Intern Outcomes

-   **Alvin Sheng**, PhD candidate, SIP 2021, NCSU Department of Statistics (Advisor: Brian Reich), Project manuscript is now in press in American Journal of Epidemiology, Included as 3rd chapter in dissertation.

-   **Jennifer Kampe**, PhD candidate, SIP 2024, Duke Department of Statistics (Advisor: David Dunson), Project is on the development of a Bayesian latent variable model for chemical mixture prediction. She is hoping it can be incorporated into her dissertation.

# Project Updates

## PrestoGP

-   `PrestoGP` and the application on US-wide groundwater pesticides is proceeding with steady progress. The publication is in preparation, but we are unlikely to get it done in 2024. Nonetheless, I am still excited at this development and the potential for a high-impact publication in late 2024 or 2025.

-   Jump over to `PrestoGP` GitHub repo and website: https://niehs.github.io/PrestoGP/

## `beethoven` SET Group Project

## 2024

-   2023/2024 was spent doing lots of logistical work and project management
-   On-boarding of a large group and setting up projects
-   TDD and software development practices has helped ensure that we are building robust and reproducible software and that I can trust what are large team is doing without having to micromanage
-   Some publications such as `PrestoGP` were not finished, but steady progress is being made and I am optimistic about the potential for high-impact publications in 2025

## 2025

-   Analytical pipelines and tools have been developed, which should make my life easier and more productive
-   I am excited about the potential for high-impact publications in 2025
-   BSC preparation is starting
    -   The two `GeoTox` manuscript (POY and package development) will considered as publications to highlight
    -   `PrestoGP` and `beethoven` will be good to highlight as current and future progress
    -   Good trainee outcomes will be highlighted
    -   Climate and health research (AJE pub, CHORDS)
    -   Software development and open science (GeoTox, PrestoGP, beethoven)

## Hiring

-   I have base funding for 2 postdocs (replacing Daniel Zilber and Ranadeep Daw)
-   I have options through CHORDS to hire data analysts and utilize SOARS (Replacing Insang Song)
-   I have options through PTB, perhaps combined with SET group CAN, to support a PhD student
