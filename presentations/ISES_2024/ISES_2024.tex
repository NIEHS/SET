\textbf{Spatiotemporal Exposures and Toxicology \{SET\} group}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Geospatial Exposure Mapping: Spatiotemporal exposure mapping of
  environmental and climate variables (e.g.~chemical mixtures, social,
  behaviorial, environmental, and climate factors)
\item
  GeoTox: Otherwise known as \textbf{source to outcome continuum}
  modeling, GeoTox is the integration of geospatial exposures,
  toxicokinetic modeling, and non-animal toxicological data such as
  high-through \emph{in vitro} screen assays to develop
  mechanistically-informed risk maps of chemical mixtures
\item
  Software Development: Developing and promoting software and
  computational best-practices such as test driven development (TDD) and
  open-source code for the environmental health sciences
\end{itemize}

  David Reif, Alison Motsigner-Reif, David Fargo, among many others
  involved a regular contributors
\item
  The project represents a major NIEHS initiative for climate change and
  health research that I am involved in. It has come with additional
  monies for postdocs and data analysts in my group
\item
  It also comes with significant time commitments and responsibilities
\item
  A lot of the CHORDS work/deliverables are folded into my group's work
  and manuscripts

\phantomsection\label{group-management}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In late 2023/ early 2024, with help from the new CHORDS funding, my
  group was poised to expand from 2 postdocs to 5 postdocs and a data
  analyst.
\item
  I took 30 hours of project management courses to prepare
\item
  I adopted software best practices as both a technique to help manage
  the group and to improve the quality of our software products, as well
  as increase software as a product of our research group
\item
  Software best practices will help ensure that I have knowledge
  retention, reproducibility, and extensibility built into the core of
  my group

  \item
    The methodology has changed from a physics-informed neural network
    to something more tractable that builds upon our previous spatial
    models and pipeline developments.

    Additionally, we hope to integrate this into the \textbf{GeoTox}
    framework towards a geospatial mixtures risk assessment.
  \end{itemize}
\item

  the \texttt{amadeus} manuscript (currently under internal NIEHS
  review).
\item
  He is interested in doing a PhD with the goal of learning and
  developing ML/AI models for environmental exposure and risk
  assessment, but has a likely geographical constraint of New England.
  Will discuss the possibility of supporting a PhD at UNC ESE.
