Knowledge of the spatiotemporal distribution of NO2 is critical for exposure and risk assessment. A common approach for assessing air pollution exposure is linear regression involving spatially referenced covariates, known as land-use regression (LUR). We develop a scalable approach for simultaneous variable selection and estimation of LUR models with spatiotemporally correlated errors, by combining a general-Vecchia Gaussian-process approximation with a penalty on the LUR coefficients. In comparisons to existing methods using simulated data, our approach resulted in higher model-selection specificity and sensitivity and in better prediction in terms of calibration and sharpness, for a wide range of relevant settings. In our spatiotemporal analysis of daily, US-wide, ground-level NO2 data, our approach was more accurate, and produced a sparser and more interpretable model. Our daily predictions elucidate spatiotemporal patterns of NO2 concentrations across the United States, including significant variations between cities and intra-urban variation. Thus, our predictions will be useful for epidemiological and risk-assessment studies seeking daily, national-scale predictions, and they can be used in acute-outcome health-risk assessments.\n\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Citation \n\n> Messier KP, Katzfuss M.
