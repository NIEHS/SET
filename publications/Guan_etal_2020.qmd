## Abstract

People are increasingly concerned with understanding their personal environment, including possible exposure to harmful air pollutants. In order to make informed decisions on their day-to-day activities, they are interested in real-time information on a localized scale. Publicly available, fine-scale, high-quality air pollution measurements acquired using mobile monitors represent a paradigm shift in measurement technologies. A methodological framework utilizing these increasingly fine-scale measurements to provide real-time air pollution maps and short-term air quality forecasts on a fine-resolution spatial scale could prove to be instrumental in increasing public awareness and understanding. The Google Street View study provides a unique source of data with spatial and temporal complexities, with the potential to provide information about commuter exposure and hot spots within city streets with high traffic. We develop a computationally efficient spatiotemporal model for these data and use the model to make short-term forecasts and high-resolution maps of current air pollution levels. We also show via an experiment that mobile networks can provide more nuanced information than an equally-sized fixed-location network. This modeling framework has important real-world implications in understanding citizensâ€™ personal environments, as data production and real-time availability continue to be driven by the ongoing development and improvement of mobile measurement technologies.
