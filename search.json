    "text": "Geospatial Exposomic Risk Assessment within the GeoTox Framework\nThe SET group is looking for a post-baccalaureate or postdoctoral fellow to further developments in the GeoTox exposomic risk assessment framework.\n\nOverview\nGeospatial approaches offer an attractive approach to quantify the exposome because external components such as the social and physical-chemical exposome are more accurately quantified with geospatial models of exposure. Toxic effects are mediated through chemicals that alter critical molecules, cells, and physiological processes inside the body. It follows that phenotypic outcomes (e.g. disease) at the individual or population level can only occur after a series of source, exposure, and biological dynamics (Figure 1). We refer to this as the source-to-outcome-continuum. It follows that if methods and data exist to quantify each step in the sequence, and each step can be integrated into each neighboring step, then individual and population outcomes can be quantified from spatiotemporally resolved environmental sources and exposures.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 - The source-to-outcome-continuum: A schematic showing the necessary sequence of events such that each step must occur for environmental exposures to cause individual and population outcomes\n\n\n\n\nResponsibilities and Expectations\nThe successful candidate will continue methodological and applications of the GeoTox exposomic risk assessment framework outlined in Eccles et al. 2023. Postdoctoral fellows will lead a project that is expected to culminate in first-author peer-reviewed publication in a top environmental health or general scientific journal. Post-baccalaureate are expected to contribute or co-lead projects and peer-reviewed publications. The candidate will also be expected to contribute to the development of the GeoTox package and the broader SET group software ecosystem.\n\n\nQualifications\nGeoTox bridges the fields of geospatial modeling and computational toxicology, thus a successful will have expertise in at least one of these fields and a willingness to learn the other. For expertise in geospatial modeling, the candidate should have experience with GIS, spatial models such as land-use regression, Gaussian processes, and machine learning applications of spatial data. For expertise in computational toxicology, the candidate should have experience with many of these research areas: computational toxicological and bioinformatic methods, toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic models, high-through in-vitro screening, in-vitro to in-vivo extrapolation, concentration-response modeling, and human health risk assessment. The candidate should also have an eagerness to learn new scientific and statistical skills in the environmental health sciences, and demonstrated and on-going ability to contribute to an interdisciplinary and inclusive research group. Most importantly, we are looking for positive, pleasant, and life-long learners.\nPostdoctoral candidates should have a Ph.D. (or doctoral equivalent) in a relevant field such as exposure science, computational toxicology, bioinformatics, geostatistics, statistics, or biostatistics.\nPostbaccaleaurate candidates should have a B.S. or B.A. in a relevant field such as environmental health science, toxicology, statistics, or computer science.\n\n\nSkills\nPreferences will be given to candidates with demonstrated skills in one or more of the following areas:\n\nCoding in R, Python, or Julia languages\nGIS software such as QGIS\nCode version control using Git\nLinux and high-performance computing cluster environments\nExperience with managing and utilizing public and internal databases\nData wrangling\nLaTeX/Overleaf\nStrong writing and communication skills"

This test should fail initially because you haven’t written the code to make it pass yet. The test defines the expected behavior of your code.\nRun the Test: Run the test to ensure it fails. This step confirms that your test is correctly assessing the functionality you want to implement.\nWrite the Minimum Code: Write the minimum amount of code required to make the test pass. Don’t worry about writing perfect or complete code at this stage; the goal is just to make the test pass.\nRun the Test Again: After writing the code, run the test again. If it passes, it means your code now meets the specified requirements.\nRefactor (if necessary): If your code is working and the test passes, you can refactor your code to improve its quality, readability, or performance. The key here is that you should have test coverage to ensure you don’t introduce new bugs while refactoring.\nRepeat: Continue this cycle of writing a test, making it fail, writing the code to make it pass, and refactoring as needed. Each cycle should be very short and focused on a small piece of functionality.\nComplete the Feature: Keep repeating the process until your code meets all the requirements for the feature you’re working on.\n\nTDD helps ensure that your code is reliable and that it remains functional as you make changes and updates. It also encourages a clear understanding of the requirements and promotes better code design.\n\n\n_targets and/or snakemake pipelines\nWe will utilize the targets and/or snakemake packages in R and Python respectively to create reproducible workflows for our data analysis. These packages allow us to define the dependencies between the steps in our analysis and ensure that our analysis is reproducible. Additionally, they keep track of pipeline objects and skip steps that have already been run, saving time and resources.\n\nSome Benefits of _targets and/or snakemake pipelines\n\nReproducibility: By defining the dependencies between the steps in our analysis, we ensure that our analysis is reproducible. This is essential for scientific research and data analysis.\nHigh-Level Abstract: _targets and snakemake allow us to define our analysis at a high level of abstraction, making it easier to understand and maintain.\nTesting: Creating pipelines and unit/integration testing go hand-in-hand together. As we write the pipeline, the tests to write become obvious."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nThere is growing evidence that exposure to ultrafine particles (UFP; particles smaller than 100 nm) may play an underexplored role inthe etiology of several illnesses, including cardiovascular disease (CVD)\n\n\nObjectives\nWe aimed to investigate the relationship between long-term exposure to ambient UFP and incident cardiovascular and cerebrovasculardisease (CVA). As a secondary objective, we sought to compare effect estimates for UFP with those derived for other air pollutants, including esti-mates from two-pollutant models.\n\n\nMethods\nUsing a prospective cohort of 33,831 Dutch residents, we studied the association between long-term exposure to UFP (predicted via land use regression) and incident disease using Cox proportional hazard models. Hazard ratios (HR) for UFP were compared to HRs for more routinely monitored air pollutants, including particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter≤10 \\(\\mu\\)m (PM10), PM with aerodynamic diameter≤2.5 \\(\\mu\\)m (PM2.5), and NO2.\n\n\nResults\nLong-term UFP exposure was associated with an increased risk for all incident CVD [HR = 1:18 per 10,000 particles= \\(cm^3\\); 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03, 1.34], myocardial infarction (MI) (HR = 1:34; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.79), and heart failure (HR = 1:76; 95% CI: 1.17, 2.66). Positive associations were also estimated for NO\\(_2\\)(HR for heart failure = 1:22; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.48 per 20\\(\\mu g /m^{3}\\)) and coarse PM (PMcoarse; HR for all CVD = 1:21; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.45 per 10\\(\\mu g /m^{3}\\)). CVD was not positively associated with PM2.5(HR for all CVD = 0:95; 95% CI: 0.75, 1.28 per 5 \\(\\mu g /m^{3}\\)). HRs for UFP and CVAs were positive, but not significant. In two-pollutant models (UFP + NO2 and UFP + PMcoarse), positive associations tended to remain for UFP, while HRs for PMcoarse and NO2 generally attenuated towards the null.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese findings strengthen the evidence that UFP exposure plays an important role in cardiovascular health and that risks of ambient air pollution may have been underestimated based on conventional air pollution metrics."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nHawai’i has the highest prevalence of nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) pulmonary disease in the United States. Previous studies indicate that certain trace metals in surface water increase the risk of NTM infection. OBJECTIVE: To identify whether trace metals influence the risk of NTM infection in O’ahu, Hawai’i. METHODS: A population-based ecologic cohort study was conducted using NTM infection incidence data from patients enrolled at Kaiser Permanente Hawai’i during 2005-2019. We obtained sociodemographic, microbiologic, and geocoded residential data for all Kaiser Permanente Hawai’i beneficiaries. To estimate the risk of NTM pulmonary infection from exposure to groundwater constituents, we obtained groundwater data from three data sources: (1) Water Quality Portal; (2) the Hawai’i Department of Health; and (3) Brigham Young University, Department of Geological Science faculty. Data were aggregated by an aquifer and were associated with the corresponding beneficiary aquifer of residence. We used Poisson regression models with backward elimination to generate models for NTM infection risk as a function of groundwater constituents. We modeled two outcomes: Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) species and Mycobacterium abscessus group species. RESULTS: For every 1-unit increase in the log concentration of vanadium in groundwater at the aquifer level, infection risk increased by 22% among MAC patients. We did not observe significant associations between water-quality constituents and infection risk among M. abscessus patients. CONCLUSIONS: Concentrations of vanadium in groundwater were associated with MAC pulmonary infection in O’ahu, Hawai’i. These findings provide evidence that naturally occurring trace metals influence the presence of NTM in water sources that supply municipal water systems."

    "text": "Abstract\nUrban concentrations of black carbon (BC) and other primary pollutants vary on small spatial scales (&lt;100m). Mobile air pollution measurements can provide information on fine-scale spatial variation, thereby informing exposure assessment and mitigation efforts. However, the temporal sparsity of these measurements presents a challenge for estimating representative long-term concentrations. We evaluate the capabilities of mobile monitoring in the represention of time-stable spatial patterns by comparing against a large set of continuous fixed-site measurements from a sampling campaign in West Oakland, California. Custom-built, low-cost aerosol black carbon detectors (ABCDs) provided 100 days of continuous measurements at 97 near-road and 3 background fixed sites during summer 2017; two concurrently operated mobile laboratories collected over 300 h of in-motion measurements using a photoacoustic extinctiometer. The spatial coverage from mobile monitoring reveals patterns missed by the fixed-site network. Time-integrated measurements from mobile lab visits to fixed-site monitors reveal modest correlation (spatial R2 = 0.51) with medians of full daytime fixed-site measurements. Aggregation of mobile monitoring data in space and time can mitigate high levels of uncertainty associated with measurements at precise locations or points in time. However, concentrations estimated by mobile monitoring show a loss of spatial fidelity at spatial aggregations greater than 100 m."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) have provided guidelines to assist in the accurate diagnosis of lung disease caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). These microbiologic, radiographic, and clinical criteria are considered equally important and all must be met to make the diagnosis of NTM lung disease. To assess the significance of the three criteria, each was evaluated for its contribution to the diagnosis of NTM lung disease in a case series. Laboratory reports of any specimen positive for NTM isolation were collected between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2010 at a university medical center. Medical records were reviewed in detail using a standardized form. The total number of patients with a culture from any site positive for NTM was 297 while the number from respiratory specimens during the same period was 232 (78%). Samples from two of these patients also yielded M. tuberculosis complex and were excluded. While 128 of the remaining 230 patients (55.7%) in the cohort met the microbiologic criterion for diagnosis of NTM lung disease, 151 (65.6%) and 189 (78.3%) met the radiologic and clinical criteria respectively. Only 78 patients (33.9%) met all three criteria provided by the ATS/IDSA for diagnosis of NTM lung disease. This evaluation reaffirms that defining NTM lung disease using either one or two of the criteria provided by the 2007 ATS/IDSA guidelines may significantly overestimate the number of cases of NTM lung disease. Based on the experience of defining NTM lung disease in this case series, recommendations for modification of the ATS/IDSA guidelines are provided which include expansion of both radiologic patterns and the list of symptoms associated with NTM lung disease."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nInfluenza peaks during the wintertime in temperate regions and during the annual rainy season in tropical regions – however reasons for the observed differences in disease ecology are poorly understood. We hypothesize that episodes of extreme precipitation also result in increased influenza in the Northeastern United States, but this association is not readily apparent, as no defined ‘rainy season’ occurs. Our objective was to evaluate the association between extreme precipitation (≥ 99th percentile) events and risk of emergency room (ER) visit for influenza in Massachusetts during 2002–2008.\n\n\nMethods\nA case-crossover analysis of extreme precipitation events and influenza ER visits was conducted using hospital administrative data including patient town of residence, date of visit, age, sex, and associated diagnostic codes. Daily precipitation estimates were generated for each town based upon data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between extreme precipitation and ER visits for influenza were estimated using conditional logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nExtreme precipitation events were associated with an OR = 1.23 (95%CI: 1.16, 1.30) for ER visits for influenza at lag days 0–6. There was significant effect modification by race, with the strongest association observed among Blacks (OR = 1.48 (1.30, 1.68)).\n\n\nConclusions\nWe observed a positive association between extreme precipitation events and ER visits for influenza, particularly among Blacks. Our results suggest that influenza is associated with extreme precipitation in a temperate area; this association could be a result of disease ecology, behavioral changes such as indoor crowding, or both. Extreme precipitation events are expected to increase in the Northeastern United States as climate change progresses. Additional research exploring the basis of this association can inform potential interventions for extreme weather events and influenza transmission."

    "text": "Abstract\nMobile and short-term monitoring campaigns are increasingly used to develop land-use regression (LUR) models for ultrafine particles (UFP) and black carbon (BC). It is not yet established whether LUR models based on mobile or short-term stationary measurements result in comparable models and concentration predictions. The goal of this paper is to compare LUR models based on stationary (30 min) and mobile UFP and BC measurements from a single campaign. An electric car collected both repeated stationary and mobile measurements in Amsterdam and Rotterdam, The Netherlands. A total of 2964 road segments and 161 stationary sites were sampled over two seasons. Our main comparison was based on predicted concentrations of the mobile and stationary monitoring LUR models at 12 682 residential addresses in Amsterdam. Predictor variables in the mobile and stationary LUR model were comparable, resulting in highly correlated predictions at external residential addresses (R2 of 0.89 for UFP and 0.88 for BC). Mobile model predictions were, on average, 1.41 and 1.91 times higher than stationary model predictions for UFP and BC, respectively. LUR models based upon mobile and stationary monitoring predicted highly correlated UFP and BC concentration surfaces, but predicted concentrations based on mobile measurements were systematically higher."

    "text": "Abstract\nAir pollution measurements collected through systematic mobile monitoring campaigns can provide outdoor concentration data at high spatial resolution. We explore approaches to minimize data requirements for mapping a city’s air quality using mobile monitors with “data-only” versus predictive modeling approaches. We equipped two Google Street View cars with 1-Hz instruments to collect nitric oxide (NO) and black carbon (BC) measurements in Oakland, CA. We explore two strategies for efficiently mapping spatial air quality patterns through Monte Carlo analyses. First, we explore a “data-only” approach where we attempt to minimize the number of repeated visits needed to reliably estimate concentrations for all roads. Second, we combine our data with a land use regression-kriging (LUR-K) model to predict at unobserved locations; here, measurements from only a subset of roads or repeat visits are considered. Although LUR-K models did not capture the full variability of on-road concentrations, models trained with minimal data consistently captured important covariates and general spatial air pollution trends, with cross-validation \\(R^2\\) for log-transformed NO and BC of 0.65 and 0.43. Data-only mapping performed poorly with few (1–2) repeated drives but obtained better cross-validation \\(R^2\\) than the LUR-K approach within 4 to 8 repeated drive days per road segment."

    "text": "Abstract\nNitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a primary constituent of traffic-related air pollution and has well established harmful environmental and human-health impacts. Knowledge of the spatiotemporal distribution of NO2 is critical for exposure and risk assessment. A common approach for assessing air pollution exposure is linear regression involving spatially referenced covariates, known as land-use regression (LUR). We develop a scalable approach for simultaneous variable selection and estimation of LUR models with spatiotemporally correlated errors, by combining a general-Vecchia Gaussian-process approximation with a penalty on the LUR coefficients. In comparisons to existing methods using simulated data, our approach resulted in higher model-selection specificity and sensitivity and in better prediction in terms of calibration and sharpness, for a wide range of relevant settings. In our spatiotemporal analysis of daily, US-wide, ground-level NO2 data, our approach was more accurate, and produced a sparser and more interpretable model. Our daily predictions elucidate spatiotemporal patterns of NO2 concentrations across the United States, including significant variations between cities and intra-urban variation. Thus, our predictions will be useful for epidemiological and risk-assessment studies seeking daily, national-scale predictions, and they can be used in acute-outcome health-risk assessments."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nAutoimmune (AI) diseases appear to be a product of genetic predisposition and environmental triggers. Disruption of the skin barrier causes exacerbation of psoriasis/eczema. Oxidative stress is a mechanistic pathway for pathogenesis of the disease and is also a primary mechanism for the detrimental effects of air pollution.\n\n\nMethods\nWe evaluated the association between autoimmune skin diseases (psoriasis or eczema) and air pollutant mixtures in 9060 subjects from the Personalized Environment and Genes Study (PEGS) cohort. Pollutant exposure data on six criteria air pollutants are publicly available from the Center for Air, Climate, and Energy Solutions and the Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group. For increased spatial resolution, we included spatially cumulative exposure to volatile organic compounds from sites in the United States Environmental Protection Agency Toxic Release Inventory and the density of major roads within a 5 km radius of a participant’s address from the United States Geological Survey. We applied logistic regression with quantile g-computation, adjusting for age, sex, diagnosis with an autoimmune disease in family or self, and smoking history to evaluate the relationship between self-reported diagnosis of an AI skin condition and air pollution mixtures.\n\n\nResults\nOnly one air pollution variable, sulfate, was significant individually (OR = 1.06, p = 3.99E−2); however, the conditional odds ratio for the combined mixture components of PM2.5 (black carbon, sulfate, sea salt, and soil), CO, SO2, benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene is 1.10 (p-value = 5.4E−3).\n\n\nSignificance\nWhile the etiology of autoimmune skin disorders is not clear, this study provides evidence that air pollutants are associated with an increased prevalence of these disorders. The results provide further evidence of potential health impacts of air pollution exposures on life-altering diseases."

In June 2021, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) held a workshop bringing together experts in exposure science, geospatial technologies, data science and population health to address the need for integrating multiscale geospatial environmental data into large population health studies. The primary objectives of the workshop were to highlight recent applications of geospatial technologies to examine the relationships between environmental exposures and health outcomes; identify research gaps and discuss future directions for exposure modeling, data integration and data analysis strategies; and facilitate communications and collaborations across geospatial and population health experts. This commentary provides a high-level overview of the scientific topics covered by the workshop and themes that emerged as areas for future work, including reducing measurement errors and uncertainty in exposure estimates, and improving data accessibility, data interoperability, and computational approaches for more effective multiscale and multi-source data integration, along with potential solutions."

In June 2021, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) held a workshop bringing together experts in exposure science, geospatial technologies, data science and population health to address the need for integrating multiscale geospatial environmental data into large population health studies. The primary objectives of the workshop were to highlight recent applications of geospatial technologies to examine the relationships between environmental exposures and health outcomes; identify research gaps and discuss future directions for exposure modeling, data integration and data analysis strategies; and facilitate communications and collaborations across geospatial and population health experts. This commentary provides a high-level overview of the scientific topics covered by the workshop and themes that emerged as areas for future work, including reducing measurement errors and uncertainty in exposure estimates, and improving data accessibility, data interoperability, and computational approaches for more effective multiscale and multi-source data integration, along with potential solutions."

Disruption of the skin barrier causes exacerbation of psoriasis/eczema. Oxidative stress is a mechanistic pathway for pathogenesis of the disease and is also a primary mechanism for the detrimental effects of air pollution.\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n              \n                \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We evaluated the association between autoimmune skin diseases (psoriasis or eczema) and air pollutant mixtures in 9060 subjects from the Personalized Environment and Genes Study (PEGS) cohort. Pollutant exposure data on six criteria air pollutants are publicly available from the Center for Air, Climate, and Energy Solutions and the Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group. For increased spatial resolution, we included spatially cumulative exposure to volatile organic compounds from sites in the United States Environmental Protection Agency Toxic Release Inventory and the density of major roads within a 5 km radius of a participant's address from the United States Geological Survey. We applied logistic regression with quantile g-computation, adjusting for age, sex, diagnosis with an autoimmune disease in family or self, and smoking history to evaluate the relationship between self-reported diagnosis of an AI skin condition and air pollution mixtures.\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n              \n                \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Only one air pollution variable, sulfate, was significant individually (OR = 1.06, p = 3.99E-2); however, the conditional odds ratio for the combined mixture components of PM2.5 (black carbon, sulfate, sea salt, and soil), CO, SO2, benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene is 1.10 (p-value = 5.4E-3).\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n              \n                \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Significance:\n        \n      \n      While the etiology of autoimmune skin disorders is not clear, this study provides evidence that air pollutants are associated with an increased prevalence of these disorders. The results provide further evidence of potential health impacts of air pollution exposures on life-altering diseases.\n    \n  \n\n  \n\n              \n                \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Significance and impact statement:\n        \n      \n      The impact of air pollution on non-pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases is understudied and under-reported. We find that air pollution significantly increased the odds of psoriasis or eczema in our cohort and the magnitude is comparable to the risk associated with smoking exposure. Autoimmune diseases like psoriasis and eczema are likely impacted by air pollution, particularly complex mixtures and our study underscores the importance of quantifying air pollution-associated risks in autoimmune disease."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe prevalence of pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) disease is increasing in the United States. Associations were evaluated among residents of central North Carolina between pulmonary isolation of NTM and environmental risk factors including: surface water, drinking water source, urbanicity, and exposures to soils favorable to NTM growth. Reports of pulmonary NTM isolation from patients residing in three counties in central North Carolina during 2006 – 2010 were collected from clinical laboratories and from the State Laboratory of Public Health. This analysis was restricted to patients residing in single family homes with a valid residential street address and conducted at the census block level (n=13,495 blocks). Negative binomial regression models with thin-plate spline smoothing function of geographic coordinates were applied to assess effects of census block-level environmental characteristics on pulmonary NTM isolation count. Patients (n = 507) resided in 473 (3.4%) blocks within the study area. Blocks with &gt;20% hydric soils had 26.8% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.8%, 58.0%), p=0.03, higher adjusted mean patient counts compared to blocks with ≤20% hydric soil, while blocks with &gt;50% acidic soil had 24.8% (−2.4%, 59.6%), p=0.08 greater mean patient count compared to blocks with ≤50% acidic soil. Isolation rates varied by county after adjusting for covariates. The effects of using disinfected public water supplies vs. private wells, and of various measures of urbanicity were not significantly associated with NTM. Our results suggest that proximity to certain soil types (hydric and acidic) could be a risk factor for pulmonary NTM isolation in central North Carolina."

    "text": "Abstract\nIn the real world, individuals are exposed to chemicals from sources that vary over space and time. However, traditional risk assessments based on in vivo animal studies typically use a chemical-by-chemical approach and apical disease endpoints. New approach methodologies (NAMs) in toxicology, such as in vitro high-throughput (HTS) assays generated in Tox21 and ToxCast, can more readily provide mechanistic chemical hazard information for chemicals with no existing data than in vivo methods. In this paper, we establish a workflow to assess the joint action of 41 modeled ambient chemical exposures in the air from the USA-wide National Air Toxics Assessment by integrating human exposures with hazard data from curated HTS (cHTS) assays to identify counties where exposure to the local chemical mixture may perturb a common biological target. We exemplify this proof-of-concept using CYP1A1 mRNA up-regulation. We first estimate internal exposure and then convert the inhaled concentration to a steady state plasma concentration using physiologically based toxicokinetic modeling parameterized with county-specific information on ages and body weights. We then use the estimated blood plasma concentration and the concentration-response curve from the in vitro cHTS assay to determine the chemical-specific effects of the mixture components. Three mixture modeling methods were used to estimate the joint effect from exposure to the chemical mixture on the activity levels, which were geospatially mapped. Finally, a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis was performed to quantify the influence of each parameter on the combined effects. This workflow demonstrates how NAMs can be used to predict early-stage biological perturbations that can lead to adverse health outcomes that result from exposure to chemical mixtures. As a result, this work will advance mixture risk assessment and other early events in the effects of chemicals."

    "text": "Abstract\nPeople are increasingly concerned with understanding their personal environment, including possible exposure to harmful air pollutants. In order to make informed decisions on their day-to-day activities, they are interested in real-time information on a localized scale. Publicly available, fine-scale, high-quality air pollution measurements acquired using mobile monitors represent a paradigm shift in measurement technologies. A methodological framework utilizing these increasingly fine-scale measurements to provide real-time air pollution maps and short-term air quality forecasts on a fine-resolution spatial scale could prove to be instrumental in increasing public awareness and understanding. The Google Street View study provides a unique source of data with spatial and temporal complexities, with the potential to provide information about commuter exposure and hot spots within city streets with high traffic. We develop a computationally efficient spatiotemporal model for these data and use the model to make short-term forecasts and high-resolution maps of current air pollution levels. We also show via an experiment that mobile networks can provide more nuanced information than an equally-sized fixed-location network. This modeling framework has important real-world implications in understanding citizens’ personal environments, as data production and real-time availability continue to be driven by the ongoing development and improvement of mobile measurement technologies."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nUnregulated private wells in the United States are susceptible to many groundwater contaminants. Ingestion of nitrate, the most common anthropogenic private well contaminant in the United States, can lead to the endogenous formation of N-nitroso-compounds, which are known human carcinogens. In this study, we expand upon previous efforts to model private well groundwater nitrate concentration in North Carolina by developing multiple machine learning models and testing against out-of-sample prediction. Our purpose was to develop exposure estimates in unmonitored areas for use in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) cohort. Using approximately 22,000 private well nitrate measurements in North Carolina, we trained and tested continuous models including a censored maximum likelihood-based linear model, random forest, gradient boosted machine, support vector machine, neural networks, and kriging. Continuous nitrate models had low predictive performance (R2 &lt; 0.33), so multiple random forest classification models were also trained and tested. The final classification approach predicted &lt;1 mg/L, 1-5 mg/L, and ≥5 mg/L using a random forest model with 58 variables and maximizing the Cohen’s kappa statistic. The final model had an overall accuracy of 0.75 and high specificity for the higher two categories and high sensitivity for the lowest category. The results will be used for the categorical prediction of private well nitrate for AHS cohort participants that reside in North Carolina."

    "text": "Abstract\nPredictive modeling is promising as an inexpensive tool to assess water quality. We developed geostatistical predictive models of microbial water quality that empirically modeled spatiotemporal autocorrelation in measured fecal coliform (FC) bacteria concentrations to improve prediction. We compared five geostatistical models featuring different autocorrelation structures, fit to 676 observations from 19 locations in North Carolina’s Jordan Lake watershed using meteorological and land cover predictor variables. Though stream distance metrics (with and without flow-weighting) failed to improve prediction over the Euclidean distance metric, incorporating temporal autocorrelation substantially improved prediction over the space-only models. We predicted FC throughout the stream network daily for one year, designating locations “impaired”, “unimpaired”, or “unassessed” if the probability of exceeding the state standard was ≥90%, ≤10%, or &gt;10% but &lt;90%, respectively. We could assign impairment status to more of the stream network on days any FC were measured, suggesting frequent sample-based monitoring remains necessary, though implementing spatiotemporal predictive models may reduce the number of concurrent sampling locations required to adequately assess water quality. Together, these results suggest that prioritizing sampling at different times and conditions using geographically sparse monitoring networks is adequate to build robust and informative geostatistical models of water quality impairment."

    "text": "Abstract\nAir pollution affects billions of people worldwide, yet ambient pollution measurements are limited for much of the world. Urban air pollution concentrations vary sharply over short distances (≪1 km) owing to unevenly distributed emission sources, dilution, and physicochemical transformations. Accordingly, even where present, conventional fixed-site pollution monitoring methods lack the spatial resolution needed to characterize heterogeneous human exposures and localized pollution hotspots. Here, we demonstrate a measurement approach to reveal urban air pollution patterns at 4–5 orders of magnitude greater spatial precision than possible with current central-site ambient monitoring. We equipped Google Street View vehicles with a fast-response pollution measurement platform and repeatedly sampled every street in a 30-km2 area of Oakland, CA, developing the largest urban air quality data set of its type. Resulting maps of annual daytime NO, NO2, and black carbon at 30 m-scale reveal stable, persistent pollution patterns with surprisingly sharp small-scale variability attributable to local sources, up to 5–8× within individual city blocks. Since local variation in air quality profoundly impacts public health and environmental equity, our results have important implications for how air pollution is measured and managed. If validated elsewhere, this readily scalable measurement approach could address major air quality data gaps worldwide."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nThe risk of indoor air radon for lung cancer is well studied, but the risks of groundwater radon for both lung and stomach cancer are much less studied, and with mixed results.\n\n\nMethods\nGeomasked and geocoded stomach and lung cancer cases in North Carolina from 1999 to 2009 were obtained from the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry. Models for the association with groundwater radon and multiple confounders were implemented at two scales: (i) an ecological model estimating cancer incidence rates at the census tract level; and (ii) a case-only logistic model estimating the odds that individual cancer cases are members of local cancer clusters.\n\n\nResults\nFor the lung cancer incidence rate model, groundwater radon is associated with an incidence rate ratio of 1.03 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01, 1.06] for every 100 Bq/l increase in census tract averaged concentration. For the cluster membership models, groundwater radon exposure results in an odds ratio for lung cancer of 1.13 (95% CI = 1.04, 1.23) and for stomach cancer of 1.24 (95% CI = 1.03, 1.49), which means groundwater radon, after controlling for multiple confounders and spatial auto-correlation, increases the odds that lung and stomach cancer cases are members of their respective cancer clusters.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur study provides epidemiological evidence of a positive association between groundwater radon exposure and lung cancer incidence rates. The cluster membership model results find groundwater radon increases the odds that both lung and stomach cancer cases occur within their respective cancer clusters. The results corroborate previous biokinetic and mortality studies that groundwater radon is associated with increased risk for lung and stomach cancer."

    "text": "Abstract\nEnvironmental toxicants overwhelmingly occur together as mixtures. The variety of possible chemical interactions makes it difficult to predict the danger of the mixture. In this work, we propose the novel Reflected Generalized Concentration Addition (RGCA), a piece-wise, geometric technique for sigmoidal dose-responsed inverse functions that extends the use of generalized concentration addition (GCA) for 3+ parameter models. Since experimental tests of all relevant mixtures is costly and intractable, we rely only on the individual chemical dose responses. Additionally, RGCA enhances the classical two-step model for the cumulative effects of mixtures, which assumes a combination of GCA and independent action (IA). We explore how various clustering methods can dramatically improve predictions. We compare our technique to the IA, CA, and GCA models and show in a simulation study that the two-step approach performs well under a variety of true models. We then apply our method to a challenging data set of individual chemical and mixture responses where the target is an androgen receptor (Tox21 AR-luc). Our results show significantly improved predictions for larger mixtures. Our work complements ongoing efforts to predict environmental exposure to various chemicals and offers a starting point for combining different exposure predictions to quantify a total risk to health."

    "text": "Abstract\nIt is known, to researchers and heavily impacted communities, that people of color face a higher average burden of air pollution. It was unknown whether racial/ethnic disparities were caused by spatial heterogeneities at the level of city blocks, neighborhoods, or urban regions. Our approach leverages a unique set of highly local observations, covering every city block of 13 cities and urban districts that are home to 450,000 people. We find that even for pollutants with steep localized gradients, differences in average outdoor concentrations among racial/ethnic groups are driven by regional variability. However, localized peaks indicate opportunities to reduce extremes within groups. The methods and findings of this study can inform strategies to reduce disparities in urban air pollution exposure."

The dependent variables were census-tract level disease prevalences generated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Bayesian spatial conditional autoregressive models were fit on this data to quantify the relationship between flood risk and health outcomes under different stratifications of social vulnerability. We showed that three flood risk principal components had small but significant associations with each of the health outcomes, across the different stratifications of social vulnerability. Our analysis gives the first United States-wide estimates of the associated effects of flood risk on specific health outcomes. We also show that social vulnerability is an important moderator of the relationship between flood risk and health outcomes.

    "text": "In this brief tutorial, we will explore how to estimate parameters for a normal distribution given observed and censored data. Censored data is encountered in many fields, including environmental science, where we often have data below the method detection limit (MDL). That is generally a good thing for public health as it means the concentration of the contaminant is below a level that we can detect; however, it is a challenge for statisticians and data analysts as more sophisticated methods are needed. Here, we show how to produce these estimates using base R code and functions."
